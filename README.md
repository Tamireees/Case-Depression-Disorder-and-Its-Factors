Depression Disorder and Its Factors

This project explores depressive disorder as a multifactorial condition, influenced by a wide range of social, behavioral, and health-related factors. Using data from the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2005‚Äì2006, the analysis aims to uncover insights about the U.S. adult population (18 years and older) experiencing depressive symptoms.

üéØ Objectives

Identify the profile of individuals with depressive symptoms in the United States during the 2005‚Äì2006 period.

Investigate lifestyle associations, focusing on whether healthy eating habits and physical activity are linked to lower levels of depression within this population.

üìä Data Description

Source: NHANES 2005‚Äì2006, publicly available through the CDC.

Population: U.S. adults (‚â•18 years old).

Key variables:

Lifestyle factors (diet quality, physical activity)

Health status (BMI, chronic conditions)

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Selection of adult participants

Handling missing values

Standardization of variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of depressive symptoms across demographic groups

Correlation between lifestyle habits and depression indicators

Statistical & Machine Learning Approaches

Logistic regression for risk factors identification

Group comparisons (healthy vs. unhealthy lifestyles)

Visualization of patterns and associations

üîé Results & Insights

Profile of individuals with depressive symptoms:

Higher prevalence among women, young adults, and those with lower income/education levels.

Lifestyle factors:

Healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity showed negative association with depressive symptoms.

Sedentary behavior and poor nutrition correlated with higher depression scores.

üìå Conclusion

This study reinforces the idea that depression is multifactorial and closely linked to both socioeconomic conditions and lifestyle behaviors. Promoting healthier habits may play a significant role in reducing the burden of depressive symptoms within the population.
